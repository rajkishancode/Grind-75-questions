Code Splitting
Code splitting in React is a technique used to split a large JavaScript bundle into smaller, manageable chunks. It helps improve performance by loading only the necessary code for a specific part of an application rather than loading the entire bundle upfront.

When you develop a new React application, all your JavaScript code is typically bundled together into a single file. This file contains all the components, libraries, and other code required for your application to function. But as your application grows, the bundle size can become quite large, resulting in slow initial load times for your users.

Code splitting allows you to divide a single bundle into multiple chunks, which can be loaded selectively based on the current needs of your application. Instead of downloading the entire bundle upfront, only the necessary code is fetched and executed when a user visits a particular page or triggers a specific action.

Below is a basic example of code splitting:

// AsyncComponent.js
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const DynamicComponent = lazy(() => import('./DynamicComponent'));

const AsyncComponent = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <DynamicComponent />
  </Suspense>
);

export default AsyncComponent;


// DynamicComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const DynamicComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <p>This is a dynamically loaded component!</p>
  </div>
);

export default DynamicComponent;
In this example, AsyncComponent is a component that uses lazy and Suspense to perform code splitting. The DynamicComponent is dynamically imported using the import() syntax.

When AsyncComponent is rendered, React will load DynamicComponent only when it is needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving the application's performance. The fallback prop in Suspense specifies what to render while waiting for the dynamic import to resolve, providing a better user experience during the loading process.
